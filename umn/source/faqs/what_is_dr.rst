What Is DR?
===========

Disaster recovery (DR) is a broad concept.

-  In a broad sense, DR is a systematic project that includes all abilities related to business continuity. Regarding IT, DR provides a computing system that protects user service systems from various disasters.
-  DR is the ability to provide continuous services after an accident, such as a fire, earthquake, or power outage. This is achieved by setting up two or more IT systems with the same functions in dispersed areas. If one system stops, the services can quickly recover on the other system and continue to run properly.

The purpose of DR is to ensure maximum service continuity in the event of a natural or human-caused disaster on production systems.
