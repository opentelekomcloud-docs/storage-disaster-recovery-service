What Are RPO and RTO?
=====================

Recovery Point Objective (RPO): the maximum data loss amount tolerated by the system.

Recovery Time Objective (RTO): the maximum service interruption duration tolerated by the system. It refers to the requirement for the recovery duration of an information system failure or service function failure caused by a disaster.
