SDRS Advantages
===============

SDRS has the following advantages:

-  Convenient service recovery

   SDRS provides a management console. You can configure and manage server replication and perform switchovers or failovers.

-  server replication

   You can establish a replication relationship between the production site and the DR site.

-  Replication on demand

   You can replicate servers in an AZ to another AZ as required, thereby reducing the costs and complexity of maintaining another data center.

-  Zero impact on applications

   You can replicate all applications on the servers. The replication has no impact on the applications.

-  RPO target

   SDRS provides continuous and synchronous replication for servers to ensure zero recovery point objective (RPO).

-  Crash consistency

   Storage-based, real-time data synchronization keeps crash consistency for your data across two AZs. Specifically, application data might not be consistent during a failover, but disk data is always consistent.

-  Seamless DR drills

   You can run disaster recovery drills without affecting ongoing replication.

-  Flexible failover

   You can perform switchovers for expected interruptions with zero data loss, or failovers for unexpected failures to recover services quickly.

-  Efficient network switchover

   Streamline resource management during switchovers or failovers, for example, to reserve IP addresses and MAC addresses.

-  Cost-effective

   When production site services are running properly, servers at the DR site are stopped. This greatly reduces the disaster recovery TCO.
