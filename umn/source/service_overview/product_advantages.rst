Product Advantages
==================

SDRS has the following advantages:

-  Convenient service recovery

   SDRS provides a management console. You can configure and manage server replication and perform a planned failover or failover.

-  server replication

   You can establish a replication relationship between the production site and the DR site.

-  Replication on demand

   You can replicate servers in an AZ to another AZ as required, thereby reducing the costs and complexity of maintaining another data center.

-  Zero impact on applications

   Applications running on servers can be replicated, and the replication will not have any impact on the applications.

-  RPO target

   SDRS provides continuous and synchronous replication for servers to ensure zero recovery point objective (RPO).

-  Crash consistency

   Storage-based, real-time data synchronization keeps crash consistency for your data across two AZs. Specifically, application data might not be consistent during a failover, but disk data is always consistent.

-  Seamless DR drills

   You can easily perform DR drills without affecting ongoing replication.

-  Flexible failover

   You can perform a planned failover for an expected service interruption to prevent data loss, or perform a failover for unexpected failures to restore services quickly.

-  Efficient network switchover

   SDRS simplifies program resource management during failovers, including reserving IP addresses and MAC addresses, all of which facilitates efficient network switchovers.

-  Excellent performance for the price

   When services are running properly, servers at the DR site are stopped and thereby will not be billed. This greatly reduces the DR TCO.
