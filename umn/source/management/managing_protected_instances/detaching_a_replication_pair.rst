Detaching a Replication Pair
============================

Scenarios
---------

You can perform steps provided in this section to detach a replication pair from a protected instance. Then, data of the servers in the protected instance will not be written in to the disks in the replication pair.

**Prerequisites**
-----------------

-  The protection group is in the **Available**, **Protecting**, **Failover complete**, **Enabling protection failed**, **Disabling protection failed**, **Planned failover failed**, or **Failover failed** state.
-  The protected instance is in the **Available**, **Protecting**, **Failover complete**, **Enabling protection failed**, **Disabling protection failed**, **Planned failover failed**, **Failover failed**, **Deletion failed**, **Re-enabling protection failed**, **Modifying specifications failed**, **Invalid**, or **Faulty** state.
-  The replication pair is in the **Available**, **Protecting**, **Failover complete**, **Attaching failed**, **Detaching failed**, **Enabling protection failed**, **Disabling protection failed**, **Planned failover failed**, **Failover failed**, **Deletion failed**, **Re-enabling protection failed**, **Expansion failed**, **Invalid**, or **Faulty** state.
-  The replication pair has been attached to a protected instance.
-  Disks in the **In-use** state have been attached to the production and DR site servers.

.. note::

   -  A system disk (mounted on the **/dev/sda** or **/dev/vda** mount point) can be detached from a server only when the server is in the **Stopped** state. Therefore, stop the server before detaching the system disk.

   -  A data disk can be detached from a server online or offline, specifically, when the server is in the **Stopped** or **Running** state.

      For details about how to detach a disk online, see **Storage** > **Detaching an EVS Disk from a Running ECS** in the *Elastic Cloud Server User Guide*.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click **Service List** and choose **Storage** > **Storage Disaster Recovery Service**.

   The **Storage Disaster Recovery Service** page is displayed.

#. In the pane of the protection group for which the replication pair is to be detached from the protected instance, click **Protected Instances**.

   The operation page for the protection group is displayed.

#. On the **Protected Instances** tab, locate the row containing the desired protected instance and click **Detach** in the **Operation** column.

   The **Detach Replication Pair** page is displayed.

#. Select the replication pair to be detached and click **Yes**.

   Then, data of the servers in the protected instance will not be written in to the disks in the replication pair.
